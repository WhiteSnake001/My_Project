"Hand Gesture and Voice Conversion for Deaf and Dumb," involves the development of a web application aimed at improving communication for individuals with hearing and speech impairments. 
The application translates hand gestures into speech and text, allowing those who are deaf or mute to communicate more effectively with others.
This innovative solution bridges the gap between sign language users and non-users by converting gestures into recognizable voice or textual output, thereby enhancing accessibility and inclusivity. 
The project showcases your skills in web development, programming, and understanding of user-centric solutions for differently-abled individuals.
